            Hi! My name is Charles Condon and I am a Computer Science student at
            NYU as well as a digital Illustrator.
            <br /><br />
            My time at NYU has allowed me to build a strong foundation of the
            fundamentals of Computer Science, from basic algorithms and data
            structures to the operations of computer systems. After building
            those foundations I have now put my focus onto the world of big data
            analysis and the vast number of programs that handle it (primarily
            using the Hadoop ecosystem). Additionally, in order to round out my
            strengths as a programmer, I have also been learning web design and
            development and found passion in this field of work as well. I am
            very proud of the work I have accomplished thus far and this very
            site is proof of my progress.
            <br /><br />
            Outside from my coursework, I am also a digital illustrator. I began
            drawing when I first arrived at college in order to expand my
            hobbies and practice a new skill that I had no prior experience in.
            After years of practice, I have created a decent following online
            and have even become a verified artist on Giphy. My work has
            consisted of still illustrations, short animations, and short
            original gifs. My greatest achievement from these thus far has by
            far been my gifs, which have currently collectively achieved over <b>45
            million</b> views.
