            Hi! My name is Charles Condon and I am a Computer Science student at NYU as well as a digital Illustrator. 
            <br><br>
            My time at NYU has allowed me to build a strong foundation
            of the fundamentals of Computer Science, from basic algorithms and data structures to the operations of computer systems. After building those foundations I have
            now put my focus onto the world of big data analysis and the vast number of programs that handle it (primarily using the Hadoop ecosystem). Additionally, in order to
            round out my strengths as a programmer, I have also been learning web design and development and found passion in this field of work as well. I am very proud of the
            work I have accomplished thus far and this very site is proof of my progress.
            <br><br>
            Outside from my coursework, I am also a digital illustrator. I began drawing when I first arrived at college in order to expand my hobbies and practice a new skill
            that I had no prior experience in. After years of practice, I have created a decent following online and have even become a verified artist on Giphy. My work
            has consisted of still illustrations, short animations, and short original gifs. My greatest achievement from these thus far has by far been my gifs, which have
            currently collectively achieved over 22 million views.
