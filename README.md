Portfolio Website
==================

This site serves as the first compete web development project I have completed,
as well as a showcase for my other accomplishments in programming and extracurriculars.

The site contains a wide variety of examples of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in
order to showcase my progress thus far and create a unique user experience.

the link to my testing site is: charlescon.glitch.me

(This site is a constant work in progress so I hope you enjoy the work so far)
