Portfolio Website
==================

This site serves as the first compete web development project I have completed,
as well as a showcase for my other accomplishments.

The site contains a wide variety of examples of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in
order to showcase my progress thus far and create a unique user experience.

(This site is a constant work in progress)
